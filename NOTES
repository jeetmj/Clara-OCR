Image formats:
--------------

pbm2bm needs to be split into two steps: reading the pixmap and splitting into closures.

the call to pbm2bm in load_page needs to be changed massively.

Hand-rolled dynamic arrays
--------------------------

There are a number of these. They are documented in common.h, in the
doc-comment titled "Global Variables". They should be replaced with
the appropriate glib data structures.


Multicall functions:
--------------------

These are functions that are called multiple times to produce
incremental results, the point usually being to keep the UI
responsive. This comes at the cost of allowing action at a distance
and making control flow non-obvious.

Because we run the UI in a seperate thread, we don't gain any
advantage from multicall functions. They need to be rewritten in the
standard style; i.e., a function does everything that it's told to in
the first call.

Multicall functions have several distinguishing features:
1) Most (if not all) variables are static
2) a "reset" parameter which handles setting the static variables to known values.
3) A return value of 0 or 1, indicating that there is more work to be done.
4) Often a "mode" (sometimes called "st") variable which handles multiple cases.

Known multicalls: (not complete list)
- pbm2bm
- find_thing
- build (st is the mode var)
- load_page
- loadpgm
- review (partially. Needs to be rewritten anyway)
- dump_session
- dump_acts
- dump_patterns
- cons
- tune_skel_global
- prepare_patterns
- blockfind
- deskew
- dump_dict
- tune_skel (?)
- review_tr
- st (kinda)


TODO
-------
-- restoring previous functionality
pattern, doubts, and tuning views
various display modes (show {words,lines,closures,symbol_merging,...})
context menu on page view

-- Cleanup

Remove multicall functions
Remove now-dead code
Modify flags to be multivalued, where appropriate
refactor data structures
  bundle up page-related stuff
  Replace hand-rolled lists (cf)
refactor control structure
  run OCR in seperate thread
Clean option parser
Relace zfopen and friends with transparent zlib support.
  blocking on 
Add tests

-- very long-term
Replace file format, to kill off the last of cml.c
