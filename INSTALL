Welcome to Clara OCR!

To compile Clara OCR and install it, edit the Makefile manually (if
required), and type

    $ make

Clara OCR is expected to compile and run with no or few changes on
most little-endian Unix-like system with X11 support.

The Clara OCR Advanced User's Manual contains some simple
compilation hints.

After the compilation, type "make install" or copy the just produced
executable "clara" and selthresh to some directory of binaries:

    $ cp clara selthresh /usr/local/bin

To produce the nroff and html documentation, type

    $ make doc

Now it's time to read the tutorial. To read the tutorial in nroff
format without installing it, type

    $ nroff -man doc/clara-tut.1 | less

Optionally, the HTML version can be read using a web browser (just
load the file doc/clara-tut.html).
